---

## 💡 Why This Project?

Setting up a virtual machine is **step zero** in cybersecurity. Here's why it matters:

- ✅ **Safe environment** — practice hacking tools without risking your main system
- ✅ **Isolated network** — test exploits in a sandboxed space
- ✅ **Snapshot feature** — revert to a clean state at any time
- ✅ **Industry standard** — security professionals use VMs daily for pen testing
- ✅ **Kali Linux** comes pre-loaded with 600+ security tools (Nmap, Metasploit, Wireshark, Burp Suite, etc.)

## ⚠️ Important: M1 Chip Considerations

> This is the most critical section for Apple Silicon users

The **Apple M1 chip uses ARM64 architecture**, which is fundamentally different from the x86_64 (Intel) architecture that most VMs are traditionally built on. This has two important implications:

**1. VirtualBox version matters.** Standard VirtualBox does not support Apple Silicon. You need **VirtualBox 7.2.4**, which includes ARM support for Apple Silicon. This version is stable enough for home lab use.

**2. You must use the ARM64 version of Kali Linux.** You cannot run the standard x86_64 Kali ISO on an M1 Mac. You must download the **ARM64** edition specifically.

### Alternative: UTM (Recommended if VirtualBox has issues)
If VirtualBox gives you trouble on M1, **UTM** is a free, Mac-native virtualization app that runs excellently on Apple Silicon with no compatibility issues. This guide covers VirtualBox, but UTM notes are included where relevant.

> 💡 Documenting both approaches makes your portfolio even more impressive.

## ✅ Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:

- [x] MacBook Pro with **Apple M1 chip**
- [x] **8 GB RAM** (we'll allocate 4 GB to the VM)
- [x] At least **50 GB of free disk space** on your 512 GB SSD
- [ ] macOS Ventura (13.x) or Sonoma (14.x) — update if needed
- [ ] Internet connection for downloads
- [ ] Admin access to your Mac

### Check Available Disk Space

Open **Terminal** (`Command + Space` → type Terminal) and run:
```bash
df -h /
```
Or go to **Apple Menu** → **System Settings** → **General** → **Storage**.

> 💡 With 512 GB total, aim to keep at least 100 GB free on your Mac. Allocate 30–40 GB for the Kali VM — this leaves you plenty of headroom. The VM in this setup uses 25.64 GB.

## 🔧 Part 1: Install VirtualBox

### Step 1.1 — Download VirtualBox for Apple Silicon

1. Go to: [https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
2. Under **VirtualBox platform packages**, click **"macOS / Apple Silicon hosts"**
   - This downloads `VirtualBox-7.2.4-xxxxxx-macOSArm64.dmg`
3. Also download the **VirtualBox 7.2.4 Extension Pack** from the same page (version must match exactly)

> ⚠️ Make absolutely sure you click **"macOS / Apple Silicon"** — NOT the Intel macOS package. The Intel version will not run on your M1.

### Step 1.2 — Install VirtualBox

1. Open the downloaded `.dmg` file
2. Double-click **VirtualBox.pkg** to launch the installer
3. Click **Continue** → **Continue** → **Install**
4. Enter your Mac password when prompted
5. macOS will show a **"System Extension Blocked"** notification — this is expected

### Step 1.3 — Allow the System Extension (Critical macOS Step)

This step is unique to macOS and must not be skipped:

1. Open **System Settings** → **Privacy & Security**
2. Scroll down until you see:
   *"System software from Oracle America, Inc. was blocked from loading"*
3. Click **Allow**
4. Authenticate with your password or Touch ID
5. **Restart your Mac** when prompted

> 🔒 This is safe. VirtualBox requires kernel-level access to emulate virtual hardware. Without this approval, VMs will fail to start.

### Step 1.4 — Install the Extension Pack

1. Open VirtualBox after restarting
2. Go to **VirtualBox** (menu bar) → **Settings** → **Extensions**
3. Click the **+** icon → select your downloaded `.vbox-extpack` file
4. Click **Install** and accept the license

The Extension Pack adds USB 2.0/3.0, RDP display, and webcam passthrough support.

---

## 🐉 Part 2: Download Kali Linux (ARM64 Version)

### Step 2.1 — Download the ARM64 ISO

1. Go to: [https://www.kali.org/get-kali/](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/)
2. Click **"Installer Images"**
3. Find the **architecture selector** and switch to **ARM64**
4. Download: `kali-linux-2025.4-installer-arm64.iso`

> ⚠️ **Do NOT download the amd64 version.** It will not run on Apple Silicon. Confirm the filename contains `arm64` before downloading.

File size is approximately **3–4 GB** — download time depends on your connection.

### Step 2.2 — Verify the Download (Security Best Practice)

Open **Terminal** and run:

```bash
shasum -a 256 ~/Downloads/kali-linux-2025.4-installer-arm64.iso
```

Compare the output hash with the SHA256 value listed on the Kali Linux official download page. They must match exactly. This confirms the file is authentic and wasn't corrupted.

## 💻 Part 3: Create the Virtual Machine

### Step 3.1 — Create a New VM in VirtualBox

1. Open **VirtualBox**
2. Click **New** (or **Machine** → **New**)
3. Fill in the following details:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Name** | `Kali Linux ARM64` |
| **Folder** | Choose a location with enough free space |
| **ISO Image** | Browse → select your `kali-linux-2025.4-installer-arm64.iso` |
| **Type** | Linux |
| **Version** | **Debian 12 Bookworm (64-bit ARM)** |

4. Check ✅ **"Skip Unattended Installation"**
5. Click **Next**

> 💡 Choosing the correct **ARM** version type is essential on Apple Silicon.

### Step 3.2 — Allocate Hardware Resources

**Memory (RAM):**

With 8 GB total on your M1 Mac:

| 2048 MB (2 GB) | Minimum — functional but slow |
| 3072 MB (3 GB) | Recommended for your setup |
| **4096 MB (4 GB)** | ✅Used in this setup - best performance |

> ⚠️ Never exceed half your total RAM. Keeping 4–5 GB for macOS ensures your host stays responsive.

**Processors:**
- Set to **4 CPUs**
- Your M1 has 8 cores — allocating 4 gives the VM good performance while leaving 4 cores for macOS

Click **Next**.

### Step 3.3 — Create the Virtual Hard Disk

1. Select **Create a Virtual Hard Disk Now**
2. Set size to **25.64 GB** (as configured in this setup)
3. Format: **VirtioSCSI** (selected automatically on ARM - better performance than SATA)
4. Type: **Dynamically Allocated** (only uses space as data fills it)
5. Click **Finish**

### Step 3.4 — Adjust Additional VM Settings

Right-click your VM → **Settings**:

- **Display** → **Screen**: Set Video Memory to **128 MB**, Graphics controller to VMSVGA

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "Kernel driver not installed" error on launch
The System Extension was blocked. Go to **System Settings** → **Privacy & Security** → scroll down → click **Allow** next to Oracle software → restart your Mac.

### Black screen or VM freezes on boot
Go to VM **Settings** → **Display** → increase Video Memory to 128 MB. Also try selecting **Install** (text mode) instead of **Graphical Install** in the boot menu.

### Wrong architecture / VM won't start
You likely downloaded the `amd64` ISO instead of `arm64`. Re-download `kali-linux-arm64.iso` from the official Kali site.

### Kali runs slowly
Close other Mac applications to free RAM for the VM. The M1 manages memory efficiently, but 8 GB is shared between macOS and the VM. Quit Chrome tabs and heavy apps while using Kali.

### No internet inside Kali
VM **Settings** → **Network** → **Adapter 1** → confirm it is enabled and set to **NAT**.

### Screen won't auto-resize after Guest Additions
```bash
sudo apt install --reinstall virtualbox-guest-x11
sudo reboot
```

### VirtualBox still has issues on M1?
Try **UTM** as an alternative: [https://mac.getutm.app](https://mac.getutm.app). It's free, open-source, and purpose-built for Apple Silicon. Download the Kali Linux UTM image directly from [https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-virtual-machines](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-virtual-machines).
